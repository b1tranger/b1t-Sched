# b1t-Sched Feature Walkthrough

I have implemented 4 new features and fixes to enhance the b1t-Sched application.

## Changes

### 1. Task Filter (Pending Tasks)
Added radio buttons to filter tasks by type (Assignment, Homework, Exam, Project, Presentation, Other) in the Pending Tasks section.
- **File**: `index.html`, `dashboard.css`, `app.js`, `ui.js`
- **Feature**:
    - Select a radio button to show only tasks of that type.
    - "Clear Filter" button appears to reset the view.
    - "No tasks" message updates contextually (e.g., "No pending Assignment(s) found").

### 2. Mobile Display Fixes
 Addressed mobile usability issues.
- **File**: `index.html`
    - **Zoom Fix**: Updated viewport meta tag to `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no`.
- **File**: `main.css`
    - **Login Scroll Fix**: Set `.auth-container` to `height: 100vh` and `overflow: hidden` to prevent unwanted scrolling on the login page.

### 3. Contributions List
Added a way to view who has contributed tasks.
- **File**: `index.html`
    - Added "Contributions" button below the FAQ section.
    - Added a modal to display the list.
- **File**: `app.js`
    - calculates contributions dynamically from the currently loaded tasks.
    - Displays a ranked table of contributors (by email prefix) and their task counts.
- **File**: `dashboard.css`
    - Styled the button and modal table.
    
### 4. Total User Counter
Added a live counter of total users.
- **File**: `index.html`
    - Added a `#total-user-counter` element.
- **File**: `dashboard.css`
    - Styled as a floating badge at the bottom-right corner.
- **File**: `app.js`
    - Fetches total user count from Firestore (`DB.getAllUsers()`) upon dashboard load.
    - *Note*: If the user lacks permission to list all users, the counter gracefully hides itself.

## Verification

### Manual Testing Steps
1.  **Task Filter**:
    *   Go to "Pending Tasks".
    *   Click "Assignment" → Verify only assignments show.
    *   Click "Exam" → Verify only exams show.
    *   Click "Clear" → Verify all tasks reappear.
2.  **Mobile Fixes**:
    *   Resize browser to mobile width.
    *   Verify login page does not have a scrollbar.
    *   Verify page does not auto-zoom (requires actual device or accurate emulation).
3.  **Contributions**:
    *   Scroll to bottom of dashboard.
    *   Click "Contributions" button.
    *   Verify modal opens with a list of users and task counts.
4.  **User Counter**:
    *   Look at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
    *   Verify a maroon badge shows the total number of users (e.g., "Users: 42").
