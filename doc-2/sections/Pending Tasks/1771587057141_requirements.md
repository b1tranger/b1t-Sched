# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the redundancy of FAQ and Contribution sections appearing on all views in the b1t-Sched single-page application. Currently, these sections are visible across all authenticated views (dashboard, profile settings, user management), which creates visual clutter and reduces the focus on view-specific content. This feature will restrict these sections to only appear on the home/landing page view (dashboard) and implement a more compact nested structure for the FAQ section.

## Glossary

- **FAQ_Section**: The Frequently Asked Questions section containing collapsible question-answer pairs
- **Contribution_Section**: The section containing a button that opens a modal showing user contribution statistics
- **Dashboard_View**: The main home/landing page view shown after login, displaying tasks and events
- **Non_Dashboard_View**: Any authenticated view other than the dashboard (profile settings, user management)
- **Router**: The hash-based SPA routing module that manages view navigation
- **Nested_FAQ_Structure**: A hierarchical dropdown structure where the three existing FAQ items are grouped inside a parent dropdown menu

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: FAQ Section Visibility Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want the FAQ section to only appear on the dashboard view, so that other views remain focused and uncluttered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the dashboard view, THE System SHALL display the FAQ_Section
2. WHEN the user navigates to any Non_Dashboard_View, THE System SHALL hide the FAQ_Section
3. WHEN the Router changes the current view, THE System SHALL evaluate whether to show or hide the FAQ_Section based on the active view
4. THE System SHALL maintain the FAQ_Section's visibility state correctly during page refreshes on the dashboard view

### Requirement 2: Contribution Section Visibility Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Contribution section to only appear on the dashboard view, so that I can access contribution statistics from the main page without seeing it on every view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the dashboard view, THE System SHALL display the Contribution_Section
2. WHEN the user navigates to any Non_Dashboard_View, THE System SHALL hide the Contribution_Section
3. WHEN the Router changes the current view, THE System SHALL evaluate whether to show or hide the Contribution_Section based on the active view
4. THE System SHALL maintain the Contribution_Section's visibility state correctly during page refreshes on the dashboard view

### Requirement 3: Nested FAQ Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want the FAQ section to be more compact with a nested dropdown structure, so that it takes up less vertical space on the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL create a parent dropdown menu titled "Frequently Asked Questions"
2. WHEN the parent dropdown is collapsed, THE System SHALL hide all three existing FAQ items
3. WHEN the parent dropdown is expanded, THE System SHALL display all three existing FAQ items as nested dropdowns
4. THE System SHALL preserve the existing functionality of each individual FAQ item (expand/collapse behavior)
5. THE System SHALL maintain the existing content and styling of all FAQ items
6. THE System SHALL use the same visual design pattern (details/summary elements) for the parent dropdown as the existing FAQ items

### Requirement 4: View Transition Behavior

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the visibility logic to integrate seamlessly with the existing routing system, so that the feature works reliably across all navigation scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Router's showView function is called, THE System SHALL update FAQ_Section and Contribution_Section visibility
2. WHEN the user uses browser back/forward navigation, THE System SHALL correctly show or hide sections based on the resulting view
3. WHEN the user directly accesses a URL with a hash route, THE System SHALL correctly show or hide sections based on that route
4. THE System SHALL not interfere with the existing navbar, footer, or other UI element visibility logic
