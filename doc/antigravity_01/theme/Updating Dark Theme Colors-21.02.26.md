please make the Dark Theme CSS change according to https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=e7f0dc-0e1407-badd93-578323-89d134&fonts=Inter-Inter

do not change anything functional, and only the looks. If there is anything that is not addressed in the color palette, keep it as it is. They could be: links, buttons (text color) etc.

since the new color palette is similar to te current one, there shouldn't be much problem we will encounter
