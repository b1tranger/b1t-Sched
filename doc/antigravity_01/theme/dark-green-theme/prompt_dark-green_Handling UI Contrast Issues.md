### User Input

#target: I want to implement site-wide dark theme that the user can switch to from the curent light theme from the profile settings page. 

#color-palette: #06402B #E3FFF5 #96D9C0 #51A687 

#instructions:
- the background should be black to dark-green gradient. The rest should follow the one-color color palette (no gradients)
- make sure that the buttons are contrasting with the background and the tests are visible.
- you may use more colors that follow the standards or the conventions of modern web browsers
- the "color theme" settings should be saved in the user data, in Firebase database. So when the user logs in, the theme is automatically switched based on their preferences.

I have attached some dark-theme website images as reference.

### Planner Response

Let me explore the key files to understand the existing structure better.

*Analyzed [colors.css](file:///e:/Git_WIP/3.%20University%20repositories/b1t-Sched/css/colors.css) *

*Analyzed [profile.js](file:///e:/Git_WIP/3.%20University%20repositories/b1t-Sched/js/profile.js) *

*Analyzed [main.css](file:///e:/Git_WIP/3.%20University%20repositories/b1t-Sched/css/main.css) *

*Analyzed [styles.css](file:///e:/Git_WIP/3.%20University%20repositories/b1t-Sched/css/styles.css) *

### Planner Response

I can see there's already a `body.dark-mode` placeholder in [colors.css](cci:7://file:///e:/Git_WIP/3.%20University%20repositories/b1t-Sched/css/colors.css:0:0-0:0). Let me now explore the profile settings HTML to understand the settings UI, and look at the existing JS files to understand how Firebase user data is stored.
