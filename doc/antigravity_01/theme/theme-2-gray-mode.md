### User Input

I want to add a third color theme. Based on the structure of the dark theme, please add another theme "Gray Mode" in the profile settings. Make the "Gray Mode" the default replacement when the system looks for a "dark mode" 

here's the color palette: https://www.realtimecolors.com/dashboard?colors=eae9f1-161616-ff6360-000000-ff8222&fonts=Inter-Inter

I have also attached a reference image at doc\suggestions\theme\image02.webp

### User Input

make the FAQ text darker for "Gray Mode" at lines 1378-1457 in @[e:\Git_WIP\3. University repositories\b1t-Sched\index.html]. do not touch anything unrelated

### Planner Response

I have added a `<style>` block directly within the FAQ `<section>` in [index.html](cci:7://file:///e:/Git_WIP/3.%20University%20repositories/b1t-Sched/index.html:0:0-0:0) to specifically make the text (paragraphs, list items, headings, and strong tags) darker for "Gray Mode". This satisfies your requirement without touching anything unrelated.

The added styles are tied specifically to the `body.gray-mode #faq-section` selector to ensure they only affect the FAQ section and only when the Gray Mode is active.

### User Input

1. make the top bar (background that contains the profile settings button) a darker
2. also make the timeline adopt the new "gray Mode"
