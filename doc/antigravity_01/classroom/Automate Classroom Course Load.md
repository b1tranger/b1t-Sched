### User Input

after signing into Google Classroom, the enrolled courses is showing first. Then if I click in one of them, the assignments related to that course loads (not all), and the toggle between "to-do" and "notices" show.

then only after I use the toggle, notices or assignments from all courses are loading. 

is it possible to load "All Courses" right after the user successfully signs into the Classroom?
