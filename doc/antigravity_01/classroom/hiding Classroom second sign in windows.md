### User Input

Google Classroom tries to check if the user is already signed in to classroom when the website is loaded. After the preloader animation,  a Google Sign-In page is shown briefly without any sign in steps taken by the user and then, the website loads normally.

Is it possible to hide that brief Google Sign-in window behind the loading screen, and only allow the Gogle Sign-in window to show when the user is required to sign in into the Google Classroom window/sidebar?
