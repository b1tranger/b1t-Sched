[Task-1]

#target: merge sections (B1+B2=B, A1+A2=A, etc.) for notice visibility 

#specificaiton:
- currently, the user's section is considered distinct if they are B1 or B2. But I want the Notice section to target the users of B1 and B2 as section B. Also make sure that no users outside the user (who added the notice) of the same section (B for example; and considering B1 and B2 together), semester and department is able to view the notices
- make the Notice cards compact and add a "See More" button to hide long texts like the Events section. clicking on it will expand the Notice. 
- update the "Edit Notice" form interface with better CSS
