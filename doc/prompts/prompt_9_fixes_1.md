# taget: fixing issues



# details:

- there are two options for adding deadline in "Pending Tasks" or  <!-- Add Task Modal -->:

1. No official Time limit

2. Set Deadline

currently, "No official Time limit" appears first, and is selected by default when adding a task. I want "Set Deadline" to apear first and be selected as default



- in <!-- Note Preview (rendered with markdown) -->, the file download link does not start downloading unless the link is opened in a new tab. And it shows a warning before downloading.



- I want FIrebase user login to automatically expire in 1 hour after logging in, in case the user forgets to logout. Is that possible to implement?



- add role-based badges beside user details in "Add Task" and "Add Events" and in "Contribution list" for "CR" and "Faculty"



- notification function does not work on mobile. Although it works in Desktop browsers.



in <!-- Upload Sites Section -->, instead of tmpfiles.org, use file.io API from https://www.file.io/developers

refer to "doc/summaries/FILE_IO_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md" and fix the following issue:

- file uploads do not show success message

- file share links are not pasted in the note section
