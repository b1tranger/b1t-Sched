# b1t-Sched UI Fixes & Guide Tooltips Walkthrough

I have successfully completed all the requested tasks to improve the Notice/Note APIs, fix mobile UI bugs, and add helpful section guides.

## Changes Completed

**[Task 1 & 1.1] University Notices & Mobile Events Sidebar**
- Modified `notice.js` and `index.html` to add a new "Refresh Notices" button. This appends `?refresh=true` to backend API calls, dynamically bypassing the caching logic to check IDs from 727 to 737.
- Updated `ui.js` and `index.html` to inject the empty state `"No upcoming events."` message into the mobile slide-out events panel when no future events exist.

**[Task 2 & 2.1] Mobile Display Zoom & Note Model Scrolling**
- Removed CSS `zoom` and implemented `adjustMobileZoom()` in `app.js` to set `document.body.style.zoom = '95%'` strictly via JavaScript for screen sizes below `768px`.
- Fixed the Chart.js visual coordinate bug for the Activity Timeline: applied specific zoom hooks to `.timeline-model` open/close events to preserve interactions without disabling zoom globally.
- Enforced `max-height: 48vh;` on `.note-preview-content` in `css/note.css` to restrict infinite vertical expansion. The content now properly enables `overflow-y: auto`, preventing the file upload tools from being pushed off-screen.

**[Task 3] Section Tooltip Guides**
- Designed a custom CSS-only `.section-guide-tooltip` class in `css/components.css` providing hover/tap behavior for sleek, informative tooltips.
- Injected `<i class="fas fa-info-circle">` icons into the headers of `Pending Tasks`, `Upcoming Events`, `Notices`, `Google Classroom`, `My Notes`, and `Activity Timeline`.

**[Task 4] Note Section Improvements**
- Successfully decoupled and merged the markdown editor and live preview components. Added a dedicated `convert to MD download link` "Shorten" feature.
- Implemented robust `file.io` 20-second timeout fallbacks for robust upload attempts.

## Verification
- Run a local server and test the layout changes dynamically resized inside a browser device emulator (Chrome DevTools).
- Mobile Events empty state will accurately verify the empty messages toggle.
- Attempt to append dense lines into a Note and watch the preview scrollbar activate.
- Tap the tooltips beside the header sections to inspect the new descriptions.
