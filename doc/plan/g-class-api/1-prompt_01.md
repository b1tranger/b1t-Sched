#target: implementing Google Classroom API to load notifications and to-do (assignments)

#specification:
- I want to add a window (for desktop display) and sidebar (for mobile display) like Notice where I will show Notifications and To-Do tasks from Google Classroom as lists. Clicking on them will take the student to the respective classroom event/page.
- no classroom codes will be shared, only those who have joined the classroom will be able to access it after clicking on the list
- users with "CR" roles can configure Classrooms with classroom codes (the CRs will be able to set it up)
- the sidebar toggle should be green color, matching the Google Classroom theme
- there should be a toggle to switch the view inside the Classroom window inside the website; from To-do (default view) to Notifications.

#instructions:
- I do not know how Google Classroom API is configured, explain it first.
