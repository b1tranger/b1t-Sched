   - Create Firestore collections with sample data
   - Copy your Firebase configuration

### Step 2: Configure Firebase in Project

1. Open `js/firebase-config.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",              // Replace with your API key
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

### Step 3: Replace Old Index File

## 🛠️ Admin Operations

### Adding New Users (Manual)

Users can sign up themselves. No manual intervention needed.

### Managing Tasks (Manual Method)

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Navigate to `tasks` collection
3. Click "Add document"
4. Fill in fields and save

### Bulk Import (Advanced)

Create a script to import from Google Sheets:

```javascript
// Example: Import tasks from array
const tasks = [/* your tasks */];

tasks.forEach(async (task) => {
  await db.collection('tasks').add(task);
});
```

---

## 🔒 Security

### Firestore Security Rules

Already set up in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`. Rules ensure:
- ✅ Only authenticated users can access data
- ✅ Users can only edit their own profile
- ✅ Users can create tasks and edit/delete their own
- ✅ Admins have full control over all tasks and events
- ✅ CRs can create department events and manage their own events
- ✅ Blocked users are restricted to read-only mode

### API Key Safety

- Firebase API keys are safe to include in client-side code
- Security is enforced through Firestore Security Rules
- Domain restrictions can be set in Firebase Console

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase not defined"

**Solution:** Check that Firebase CDN scripts are loaded before your app scripts in `index.html`

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors

**Solution:** 
1. Check Firestore Security Rules
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check browser console for detailed errors

### Issue: Tasks not showing

**Solution:**
1. Verify tasks exist in Firestore with matching department/semester/section
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure `status` field is "active"
4. Check deadline is in the future

### Issue: Resource links not appearing

**Solution:**
1. Check `resourceLinks` collection has document for user's department
2. Verify `resources` array field exists
3. Check URLs are valid

## Feature Request:

from [@K. M. Jakaria (0432310005101037)](https://github.com/Reaper-X003)
   1. dark theme [1d16168e1616d84040eeeeee](https://colorhunt.co/palette/1d16168e1616d84040eeeeee)
   2. light theme [7d0a0abf3131ead196eeeeee](https://colorhunt.co/palette/7d0a0abf3131ead196eeeeee)



from [@MuhammadShishir](https://github.com/MuhammadShishir):
   1. Time tracking,
   2. Adding documents,
   3. Adding AI support, 
   4. Add a timeline view and table view ....
```
I will need some elaboration:
1. Time Tracking: Timeline? like who posted what and when? Is it a different feature?
2. Document adding: I will be making a Qbank, Insha Allah. Will import that feature (adding questions) as other file upload here.
3. AI support: how about a model trained with my whole resources dump of all questions, notes, outlines collected?
```
   Install clickup and see, 
   1. Time tracking is per task time tracking using a stop watch or timer button per task
   2. In a task many documents r generated or given to use, if we add them here it will be easy to maintain and later we can just share the link to people who need it
   3. AI support is for updating tasks, creating files and answering questions
   4. The two views I mentioned r the easiest, just call ur tasks into two tabs, one should look like a table of task and another will have calender view and tasks in them showing u ur work timeline, just go to clickup for reference ....

from [@foxxie911](https://github.com/foxxie911)
   1. need to refine data/files 
   2. add PDF viewer: need to view resources inside the website/app (otherwise I am depending on outside sources --> not convincing)
   3. Faculty-side
