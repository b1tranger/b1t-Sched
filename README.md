   - Create Firestore collections with sample data
   - Copy your Firebase configuration

### Step 2: Configure Firebase in Project

1. Open `js/firebase-config.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase configuration:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {

## 🛠️ Admin Operations

### Adding New Users (Manual)

Users can sign up themselves. No manual intervention needed.

### Managing Tasks (Manual Method)

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Navigate to `tasks` collection
3. Click "Add document"
4. Fill in fields and save

### Bulk Import (Advanced)

Create a script to import from Google Sheets:

```javascript
// Example: Import tasks from array
const tasks = [/* your tasks */];

tasks.forEach(async (task) => {
  await db.collection('tasks').add(task);
});
```

---

## 🔒 Security

### Firestore Security Rules

Already set up in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`. Rules ensure:
- ✅ Only authenticated users can access data
- ✅ Users can only edit their own profile
- ✅ Users can create tasks and edit/delete their own
- ✅ Admins have full control over all tasks and events
- ✅ CRs can create department events and manage their own events
- ✅ Blocked users are restricted to read-only mode

### API Key Safety

- Firebase API keys are safe to include in client-side code
- Security is enforced through Firestore Security Rules
- Domain restrictions can be set in Firebase Console

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase not defined"

**Solution:** Check that Firebase CDN scripts are loaded before your app scripts in `index.html`

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors

**Solution:** 
1. Check Firestore Security Rules
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check browser console for detailed errors

### Issue: Tasks not showing

**Solution:**
1. Verify tasks exist in Firestore with matching department/semester/section
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure `status` field is "active"
4. Check deadline is in the future

### Issue: Resource links not appearing

**Solution:**
1. Check `resourceLinks` collection has document for user's department
2. Verify `resources` array field exists
3. Check URLs are valid

   - [ ] promote to 59 batch juniors
   - [ ] click logo to go to home screen

from [@Helal Udding Patwary (Shakil) (0432410005101086)](https://github.com/Binary-Eclipse)
   - [ ] short faq explaining each section

from [@K. M. Jakaria (0432310005101037)](https://github.com/Reaper-X003)
   - [ ] dark theme [1d16168e1616d84040eeeeee](https://colorhunt.co/palette/1d16168e1616d84040eeeeee)

   - [x] Add Monthly Calender view for mobile Tasks.
   - [x] Add Classroom tasks atumatically adding to the tasks (Automation) (admin: added a button to "sync" the assignments and add them as tasks)



from [@MuhammadShishir](https://github.com/MuhammadShishir):
   - [x] Time tracking,
   - [x] Adding documents,
   - [ ] Adding AI support, 
   - [x] Add a timeline view and table view ....
```
I will need some elaboration:
1. Time Tracking: Timeline? like who posted what and when? Is it a different feature?
2. Document adding: I will be making a Qbank, Insha Allah. Will import that feature (adding questions) as other file upload here.
3. AI support: how about a model trained with my whole resources dump of all questions, notes, outlines collected?
```
   Install clickup and see, 
   - [ ] Time tracking is per task time tracking using a stop watch or timer button per task ( admin: added timeline, but no timer for each ask)
   - [ ] In a task many documents r generated or given to use, if we add them here it will be easy to maintain and later we can just share the link to people who need it ( admin: added temp uploads in notes )
   - [ ] AI support is for updating tasks, creating files and answering questions
   - [x] The two views I mentioned r the easiest, just call ur tasks into two tabs, one should look like a table of task and another will have calender view and tasks in them showing u ur work timeline, just go to clickup for reference ....

from [@foxxie911](https://github.com/foxxie911)
   - [ ] need to refine data/files (all digital versions; routines formatted)
   - [x] add PDF viewer: need to view resources inside the website/app (otherwise I am depending on outside sources --> not convincing)
   - [x] Faculty-side ( admin: have added the roles, they have separate space for tasks in theory)
   - [ ] add a feature, the semester of each student will update automatically at the end of semester, or with only one push of button by admin
