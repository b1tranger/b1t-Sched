# Archive Folder

This folder contains legacy files and folders that were part of the original b1t-Sched project before the v2.0 SPA redesign.

## Contents

| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Events.html` | Old static events page |
| `Semesters.html` | Old static semesters page |
| `index-old-backup.html.html` | Backup of the old index.html |
| `README-old.md` | Old README file |
| `Abstraction/` | Old abstraction/prototype files |
| `D1/` | Legacy department schedule files (CSE, IT semesters) |
| `Note/` | localStorage/sessionStorage code examples |

## Note

These files are kept for reference purposes only. The current application uses `index.html` as the single entry point with JavaScript modules for the SPA functionality.
